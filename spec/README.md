    it 'should be suggested to favourite'
    it 'should be easily favourite-able'

```
* undecided 
    * cookies instead of favourite to */**/main/`uuid`
    * the latter is linkable from a mobile desktop

```coffee

describe 'registration', -> 

    context 'classification', -> 

        context 'question sequence', -> 

            context 'question one', -> 


```
* i `HOPE` you'll forgive the occasional impersonal terms that come into play
* classification is a necessary mechanism of allignment
